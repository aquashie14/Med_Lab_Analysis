# Med_Lab_Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization notebook for a private medical diagnostic laboratory dataset. The goal is to provide business insights about revenue drivers, result turnaround times, patient retention, and referral sources to support operational and marketing decisions.

### Contents
- `Data/` - raw and cleaned CSV files used by the notebook
	- `Data.csv` — original dataset (test transactions)
	- `Med_Lab_Cleaned.csv` — cleaned dataset produced by the notebook
- `Notebooks/MLA.ipynb` — the main analysis notebook (data cleaning, EDA, visualizations)
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies used for the analysis

Key analyses performed
- Revenue by test category and test type
- Distribution of result turnaround times by test category and peak/off-peak periods
- New vs returning patient analysis and average spending
- Referral source contribution to patient counts and revenue
- Monthly trends for revenue and patient flow (correlation analysis)

## Quickstart (Windows PowerShell)
1. Create a Python virtual environment (recommended)

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Install dependencies

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the analysis notebook

Open `Notebooks/MLA.ipynb` in Jupyter / VS Code and run the cells in order. The notebook reads the data from `Data/Data.csv`, performs cleaning, saves `Notebooks/Med_Lab_Cleaned.csv`, and generates several PNG charts in the notebook's working directory.

## Notes on data cleaning
- The notebook coerces the `Result Time (Hrs)` column to numeric and fills missing values using the column median.
- Date columns are parsed to datetime format for time-based analyses.
- Categorical columns are standardized (e.g., trimming whitespace, consistent casing).

## Outputs
- PNG charts saved by the notebook (examples):
	- `Revenue_by_Test_Category.png`
	- `Top_10_Test_Types_by_Revenue.png`
	- `Result_Time_by_Category_and_Time_Period.png`
	- `Average_Spending_by_Patient_Type.png`
	- `Revenue_by_Referral_Source.png`
	- `Monthly_Revenue.png`
	- `Monthly_Patient_Flow.png`
	- `Revenue_vs_Patient_Flow.png`

## Troubleshooting
- If you see TypeError or other issues when computing statistics on `Result Time (Hrs)`, ensure the notebook cell that handles missing values has been executed. That cell coerces `Result Time (Hrs)` to numeric with `pd.to_numeric(..., errors='coerce')` and fills NaNs with the median.
- If plots do not render in VS Code, try running the notebook in Jupyter Lab/Notebook or ensure `%matplotlib inline` (or proper backend) is set.
